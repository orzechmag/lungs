# Supplementary materials supporting the findings of the article entitled Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma and Lung Adenocarcinoma differential gene expression regulation through pathways of Notch, Hedgehog, Wnt and ErbB signalling by Anusewicz et al.

This repository offers supplementary files supporting the project analyzing global biological differences between lung squamous cell carcinoma and lung adenocarcinoma.

It includes supplementary data such as R scripts and extended result lists providing reproducibility of the results demonstrated in the article by Anusewicz et al. entitled Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma and Lung Adenocarcinoma differential gene expression regulation through pathways of Notch, Hedgehog, Wnt and ErbB signalling published in Scientific Reports (Nature).

Anusewicz, Dorota, Magdalena Orzechowska, and Andrzej K. Bednarek. "Lung squamous cell carcinoma and lung adenocarcinoma differential gene expression regulation through pathways of Notch, Hedgehog, Wnt, and ErbB signalling." Scientific reports 10.1 (2020): 1-15.

The available data:
1. full lists of the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)
2. R code of Weighted Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA)
3. R code of Multiple Factor Analysis (MFA)
4. R code of cross-validation of the results with Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) data
