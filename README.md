This repository offers supplementary files supporting the project analyzing global biological differences between lung squamous cell carcinoma and lung adenocarcinoma.

It includes supplementary data such as R scripts and extended result lists providing reproducibility of the results demonstrated in the article by Anusewicz et al. entitled Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma and Lung Adenocarcinoma differential gene expression regulation through pathways of Notch, Hedgehog, Wnt and ErbB signalling currently considered by the International Journal of Molecular Sciences for publication.

The available data:
1. full lists of the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)
2. R code of Weighted Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA)
3. R code of Multiple Factor Analysis (MFA)
4. R code of cross-validation of the results with Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) data
